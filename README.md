# hello-world
My first repository (how original)

I'm getting too old for this shit.
Or am I?
I might be knocking on a bit and have a few grey hairs (what hairs I have left, that is) but I reckon I'm primed for taking on the digi world.
With my family behind me, some health and a bit of perseverance I have huge confidence in what I can achieve.
